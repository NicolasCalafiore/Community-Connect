Objective: 
This was my second iteration of CCv1 (A long-running program I have been consistently upgrading since 2019). This program is runnable but does not fully function. It was mostly used for me to help practice my GUI design using Swing as there is considerable improvement in the appearance compared to CCv1.


Functions:

  - Nothing much. This release was mostly a visual upgrade (although some functions were implemented most remain unimplemented).

Notes:

  - To run this program you must go to BadFrag v2\Group Managment Major\src\administrativeClass.class and to run the server you must go to BadFrag v2\Group Managment Major Server\src\NIKKIT_GM_Server.class

  - This will be my last test run of CC as I plan to develop CCv3 to be a fully-functioning group management software product (although no commercial plans are planned I still feel obligated to finish once and for all the project I sought to build back in 2018-2019.

Date: circa. Mid 2021

This project was created around 2021 and will not be returned to.
