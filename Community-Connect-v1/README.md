Objective: 
A program I made in late 2018 . This program was specifically made for an online community that I was apart of to keep track of its member. This program was one my first program with a functioning GUI giving this program the primary objective of introducing me to Java Swing and I/O Classes.

Be Sure To Check Out The Media File To See GIFS Of The Working Program

Functions:
  - The files that were created to store data would be saved to a folder that was a third-party program called "sync" which will sync all the files with other
members that had the program. The program works but the graphics are broken. This project was the beggining of my GUI-Design journey.
  - Manually register new members
  - Edit and view the records of current members (Strikes, Absences, Awards, Notes)

Notes:
  - It was my very first GUI project and I got way too ambitious
  - This program is abandoned but usable. All the functions of the application works but the program is:
      -Unmodular
      -Extremely outdate UI & UI Practices
      -Very sloppy
  - This program was developed using DrJava. My limited knowlede of Swing along with the absence of a visual editor in DrJava led to an extremely unwelcoming UI.
      
Date: circa. Mid 2018

This project was created around 2018 and will not be updated. I hope to release a fix for the background image early 2023. Afterwards this project will be sealed.
