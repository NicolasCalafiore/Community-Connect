A Group Management Program I have been working on and upgrading since 2018 during my time in Highschool
Although the first version has never been released I have decided to slowly create better and better versions to improve my programming outside of university.

#TL;DR: Unfortunately both versions are unable to be ran on an external computer

  - Unfortunately my programming practices were not good at the time so no comments nor runnable version is available due to how I decided how to structure the program       assets so a stand-alone runnable version is unavailable. Even when released as source code and opened in an IDE the way I imported external libraries leads to alot       of errors when opened on a different computer.
 
 - Be sure to check out the screenshot files as they provide an opportunity to see what the program looked like.
 
 
 
#What is community connect?
Community Connect was a program I had conceived of for an online community I was apart of to track members and their information. 

In CCv1 You Could:
  - Add Member
  - Search Member Information
  - Edit Member Information
  
In CCv2 I decided to add:
  - A much improved UI design
  - Events/Calendar                       || Designed and semi-functional
  - Announcements/Notificaitons           || Designed and semi-functional
  - Group Hierarchies                     || Designed and semi-functional
  - Administrative Powers                 || Semi-Designed and not-functional
  - A Member Portal                       || Designed and semi-functional

Midway through CCv2 I instead decided the abandon the project to focus on my unviersity studies and to take time to fully learn Java that is why so much have already been designed in the UI but only semi-implemented in functional. 

CCv3 I plan to:
  - Develop using WPF in C#
  - Develop an IOS app using Xamarin
  - Implement much needed OOP principles (Inheritence, Objects, Improved Classes, Improvded Methods etc.)
  - Implement much needed programming designs (Startegy, Command, Factory etc.)
  - Create much more readable, commented code
