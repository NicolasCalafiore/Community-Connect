# Community Connect
## What the program is about (Version Independant)
Community Connect is a program I have developed since 2018. It is a program that can be used to register members to a community, keep track of their information, community polls, and plan events and activites. As the years passed I have used this program to give me a reason to study programming outside of academics. I hope to continue this program further as I continue to learn more.

#### Created: Late 2019

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## About Version One
 - Created Mid 2018 
 - Java
 - Swing (GUI)
 
 - Manually add members
 - Keep Tracks of absences, strikes , awards and notes
 - Keeps track of a members role, rank and beggining date
 - Used third-party software to sync the information of all members with each client that had this application
 
 - First Program I Developed with a UI
 - Unfortunately a standalone runnable application is unabled to be released due to how poorly I structured my project
 - A Screenshots folder can be found to view what the program looked like
 - Was originally built for an online gaming community I was apart of.

 ## About Version Two
 - Started Late 2020
 - Incomplete & Abandoned
 - Java
 - Swing (GUI)
 
 - Same functionaly of v1 plus:
    - Calendar for community events
    - Flexible Group Structure
    - Inbox Messaging
    - Polls
 - A vastly improved UI
 - A member portal that could be used by members to sign up independantly.
 - Members could also view their information and interact with the community.
 - Unfortunately a standalone runnable application is unabled to be released due to how poorly I structured my project
 - A Screenshots folder can be found to view what the program looked like
 
 - Alot of the logic was at one point working but either very sloppy or incomplete.
 - I consider this project a success for UI improvement and Ideas but a failure for my application of the logic and systems.

 ## About Version Three (WIP)
  - Started Late 2022
  - Active Development (As of Jan 2023)
  - C#
  - WPF (Im am also considering .NET MAUI)
  
  - A cleaner, more alive, more modern and flexible UI (WIP)
  - A more generic-platform program to allow more personalized customization community-wise (WIP)
  - Im sure i'll get more ideas along the way
 
  - I am attempting to develop this program using what I have learned since 2018 to build upon the many areas of skills that I lacked
  
 #### This is a bigger program so I tend to develop this one slower so I could focus on other small projects that can allow me to learn specific concepts faster.
